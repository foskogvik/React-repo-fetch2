Hosted at vercel: https://react-repo-fetch2.vercel.app/

React app that fetches the top 100 repos from github and renders them in a table.
Built with React with hooks, webpack and styled components.

Known issues:
Changing repos per page on other pages then 1 gets weird.
Various responsive issues. Hard to work out because of tables.
